NAME
       st - simple terminal (Modified version of Luke Smith (https://lukesmith.xyz)'s build)

SYNOPSIS
       st  [-aiv] [-c class] [-f font] [-g geometry] [-n name] [-o iofile] [-T ti‐
       tle] [-t title] [-l line] [-w windowid] [[-e] command [arguments...]]

       st [-aiv] [-c class] [-f font] [-g geometry] [-n name] [-o iofile] [-T  ti‐
       tle] [-t title] [-w windowid] -l line [stty_args...]

DESCRIPTION
       st is a simple terminal emulator.

OPTIONS
       -a     disable alternate screens in terminal

       -c class
              defines the window class (default $TERM).

       -f font
              defines the font to use when st is run.

       -g geometry
              defines     the     X11    geometry    string.     The    form    is
              [=][<cols>{xX}<rows>][{+-}<xoffset>{+-}<yoffset>]. See  XParseGeome‐
              try(3) for further details.

       -i     will fixate the position given with the -g option.

       -n name
              defines the window instance name (default $TERM).

       -o iofile
              writes all the I/O to iofile.  This feature is useful when recording
              st sessions. A value of "-" means standard output.

       -T title
              defines the window title (default 'st').

       -t title
              defines the window title (default 'st').

       -w windowid
              embeds st within the window identified by windowid

       -l line
              use a tty line instead of a  pseudo  terminal.   line  should  be  a
              (pseudo-)serial device (e.g. /dev/ttyS0 on Linux for serial port 0).
              When this flag is given remaining arguments are used  as  flags  for
              stty(1).   By  default  st initializes the serial line to 8 bits, no
              parity, 1 stop bit and a 38400 baud rate. The speed is  set  by  ap‐
              pending  it as last argument (e.g. 'st -l /dev/ttyS0 115200'). Argu‐
              ments before the last one are stty(1) flags. If you want to set  odd
              parity  on 115200 baud use for example 'st -l /dev/ttyS0 parenb par‐
              odd 115200'. Set the number of bits by  using  for  example  'st  -l
              /dev/ttyS0 cs7 115200'. See stty(1) for more arguments and cases.

       -v     prints version information to stderr, then exits.

       -e command [ arguments ... ]
              st  executes  command instead of the shell.  If this is used it must
              be the last option on the command line, as in xterm  /  rxvt.   This
              option is only intended for compatibility, and all the remaining ar‐
              guments are used as a command even without it.

CUSTOMIZATION
       st can be customized by creating a custom config.h  and  (re)compiling  the
       source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
